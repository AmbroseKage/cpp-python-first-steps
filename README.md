# Structured and Object-Oriented Programming – My Practice Repo

This repository contains tasks and exercises from the semester course  
**"Programowanie Strukturalne i Obiektowe"** (Structured and Object-Oriented Programming),  
where I'm learning the fundamentals of programming in **C++** and **Python**.

## 💡 About

These tasks are part of my journey into programming – covering:
- basic syntax and logic in Python and C++
- structured programming (functions, control flow, I/O)
- object-oriented programming (classes, encapsulation, etc.)
- memory management (C++), vectors, arrays, and simple math operations
- unit testing (e.g. using GoogleTest in C++)

## 📁 Folder structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `c++/` | Exercises written in C++ – classes, arrays, memory, vectors |
| `python/` | Basic Python scripts – syntax, loops, functions, etc. |
| `test/` | Unit tests (mostly C++) using GoogleTest |
| `cmake/` | CMake config and project setup |

> 🧪 The code is mostly based on university tasks, but adapted and expanded for my personal learning.

## 🔧 Technologies used

- C++ (GCC, CMake)
- Python 3
- Google Test
- Visual Studio Code

## 📌 Purpose

This repo is mainly for educational purposes and personal progress tracking.  
If you're also learning programming – feel free to explore and use any part of it!
