# Structured and Object-Oriented Programming – My Practice Repo

This repository contains tasks and exercises from the semester course  
**"Programowanie Strukturalne i Obiektowe"** (Structured and Object-Oriented Programming),  
where I'm learning the fundamentals of programming in **C++** and **Python**.

## 💡 About

These tasks are part of my journey into programming – covering:
- basic syntax and logic in Python and C++
- structured programming (functions, control flow, I/O)
- object-oriented programming (classes, encapsulation, etc.)
- memory management (C++), vectors, arrays, and smart pointers
- unit testing (e.g. using GoogleTest in C++)
- basic numerical and mathematical operations (MATLAB-inspired)

## 📁 Folder structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Matlab2_JK/` | Vector operations, norm calculation |
| `Matlab3_JK/` | Overloaded operators and object handling |
| `Matlab6_7_8_JK/` | Deep copy, custom math, and extra class logic |
| `More About Classes/` | OOP features: inheritance, encapsulation, methods |
| `Relationships Between Classes/` | Working with relationships: association, aggregation, inheritance |
| `Smart Pointers_JK/` | Exploring `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr` and memory management in modern C++ |
| `Python1_JK/` | First steps in Python – variables, input/output, loops |
| `Python2_JK/` | Functions, lists, conditions |
| `Python3_JK/` | Working with files, basic error handling |

> 🧪 Most code comes from university assignments but is structured for self-study and experimentation.

## 🔧 Technologies used

- C++ (GCC, CMake)
- Python 3
- Google Test
- Visual Studio Code

## 📌 Purpose

This repo is mainly for educational purposes and personal progress tracking.  
If you're also learning programming – feel free to explore and use any part of it!
